</b></h5><p>
<?php echo SITE_NAME;?> cares about and respects your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our products, services and websites (collectively, our “Services”). Your personal data includes information such as:

NameEmail addressIP addressOnline identifiers, such as usernames (which may be provided by you or by us).Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you

Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data. It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.

If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach us by contacting us at era2applications@gmail.com . This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can provide you with information you can confidently trust.
</p><h5><b>
What information do we collect
</b></h5><p>
We collect information to provide the best possible experience when you use our Services. Much of what you consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:

Create an account or purchase any of our Services (e.g. billing information, including name, address, and credit card number).Request assistance from our Customer Services team (e.g. telephone number).Complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (e.g. email courses, e-books, or emails).Participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.

However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious, so we wanted to explain what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:

<b>Account related information</b> is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, products you have purchased, when products renew or expire, information requests, support requests, and notes or details on our interactions.

<b>Cookies and similar technologies</b> on our websites allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, and your device types. They also allow us to collect data (including analytics) about how you use and interact with our Services. This allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyse, and improve the performance of our Services. We may also collect your location via Internet Protocol (IP) address, so that we can personalize our Services.

<b>Data about Usage of Services</b> is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, and location information. This information includes specific data about your interactions with the features, content, and links (including third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, IP address, browser type and settings (including configuration and plug-ins), the date and time the Services were used, language preferences and cookie data, and information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, and error data. Some of this data collected might be capable of and be used to approximate your location.

<b>Supplemented Data</b> may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand, and analyse the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
</p><h5><b>
How we use information
</b></h5><p>
We strongly believe in both reducing the amount of data we collect and limiting the use and purpose of that data to only:

Data for which we have been given permissionData necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact withData we might be required or permitted to keep for legal compliance or other lawful purposes.

We utilise this information to:

Improve and optimise the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the ServicesDetect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systemsCollecting aggregate statistics about use of the ServicesUnderstand and analyse how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you.

Often, much of the data we collect is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data. But as it is itself personal data, or it can be linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly.
</p><h5><b>
Sharing with trusted third parties
</b></h5><p>
We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third-party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:
